<!--
  ⚠️  CRITICAL RULE — READ BEFORE FILLING THIS TEMPLATE:
  NEVER invent a person that does not exist. Do NOT fabricate names, ages,
  occupations, or personal details. If no real interview or user research data
  is available, use persona_type: "archetype" and describe the role/archetype
  in abstract terms without fake personal attributes.

# {{ persona }}

## 1. Type

<!-- Delete the option that does NOT apply -->

**Real persona** — This document is grounded in actual interviews or direct observation of a real person. Every personal detail (name, age, quote) has a verifiable source.

**Archetype** — This is a role-based composite representing a class of users. No real person with these exact attributes exists. The description captures patterns and needs common to this user segment without fabricating personal details.

## 2. Snapshot

> One paragraph describing this persona or archetype: who they are (or what role they represent), when they touch the product, what is on their mind.

| **Type**           | {{ persona_type }} |
| **Age range**      | <!-- For real personas: e.g. 25-35. For archetypes: "Varies" or leave as N/A --> |
| **Role / context** | <!-- e.g. busy parent, field technician, casual buyer, system administrator --> |
| **Device / setup** | <!-- mobile, desktop, in-the-field, low bandwidth --> |
| **Digital literacy** | <!-- low / medium / high --> |

<!-- For archetype personas: remove or comment out age_range if not applicable -->

  For real personas: use a VERBATIM quote from an interview. Include the source.
  For archetypes: use "—" or state "No direct quote available (archetype)."
  NEVER fabricate a quote.
