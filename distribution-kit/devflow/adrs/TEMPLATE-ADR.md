<!--
  LANGUAGE POLICY (§3.15): YAML keys, status enums, IDs, and section
  headings (##) stay in English (the schema). ADR titles and prose —
  context, decision, consequences — go in the project's content_language
  (declared in devflow/LANGUAGE). `AITL-ADR-Approval` is never translated.
  See devflow/README.md -> Language policy.

  ⚠️ AITL-ADR-Approval: An ADR remains a DRAFT until an Architect or
  Tech Lead records AITL-ADR-Approval (§2.8, §3.5). A draft ADR cannot
  govern a SPEC, establish an NFR, authorize an exception, or be treated
  as an accepted decision. No approval is inherited from related artifacts.

  ⚠️ ADR CONFLICTS (§2.8): Before approval, check the decision log for
  active ADRs that contradict this one. If any exists, do NOT approve
  this ADR as-is: declare the conflict via `conflicts_with` and create
  the superseding ADR that explicitly overrides them. A SPEC whose
  `sources` include mutually exclusive active ADRs is blocked by the
  pre-SPEC evidence gate (§2.4.1) until the conflict is resolved.

# ADR-NNN — [Descriptive title]

| Field          | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| **Status**     | [draft / accepted / rejected / deprecated / superseded] |
| **Decision-makers** | [team / roles] |
| **Sources**    | [REV-NNN, DISC-NNN, previous ADRs] |
| **Supersedes** | [ADR-NNN it replaces, or "None"] |
| **Conflicts with** | [ADRs contradicted by this decision, or "None" — §2.8] |

---

## 1. Context

[Problem or need that motivated the decision. Include constraints and
forces at play. Reference DISCs and REVs that evidence the problem.]

---

## 2. Alternatives considered

### Alternative A — [Name] (✅ Selected)

| Aspect   | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Pros** | [advantages] |
| **Cons** | [disadvantages] |

### Alternative B — [Name]

| Aspect   | Detail |

## 3. Decision

[Clear statement of what was decided. "We adopt Alternative A because…"]

---

## 4. Consequences

**Positive:**
- ...

**Trade-offs:**
- ...

**Technical debt:**
- ...

## 5. Applicable NFRs

[If this ADR defines or governs non-functional requirements. NFRs are
defined and governed inside approved ADRs — never in USs, ACs, Bolts or
SPECs (§2.7).]

| NFR | Description | Threshold | How it is measured |
|-----|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
|     |             |           |                   |

## 7. AITL-ADR-Approval

> **AITL-ADR-Approval** (Avenga DevFlow §2.8, §3.0, §3.5). An ADR does not
> become `accepted` — and therefore governing — without the approval of an
> Architect / Tech Lead. This ADR is the **source of truth for its own
> approval** (recorded in the `review` frontmatter block with review
> evidence); when it governs a SPEC revision, its path appears in that
> revision's `sources`. ADR approvals are never copied to the Bolt manifest.
