# Adversarial Reviews — Index

**Methodology version:** 5.1

Structured adversarial debates: LLM models participate in a
**Critique → Defense → Verdict** protocol to evaluate code against SPEC/ADRs,
best practices, or specific reference sources. Read-only in all phases — they
only document findings, arguments and a final verdict.

AREVs can be **Bolt-bound** (they choose a completed V-Bounce package as
their subject — never a stage of the V-Bounce, §2.15), **themed** (focused on
security, architecture, performance, etc.) or **ad-hoc** (exploratory on any
part of the code). They are **optional for all risk classes** (stakeholder-
triggered), but once initiated the three phases are mandatory and sequential,
each requiring its own approval: `AITL-AREV-CRITIQUE-Approval`,
`AITL-AREV-DEFENSE-Approval`, `AITL-AREV-VERDICT-Approval`. AREV state is
never written to a Bolt manifest.
