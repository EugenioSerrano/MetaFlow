> ⛔ **DORMANT / RESERVED (v4.2).** The UNIT/UAT approval-and-release layer was
> **removed from the active flow in v4.2** — `AITL-UAT-Approval` is **not an
> active checkpoint** in this release. The governed flow ends at Bolt
> acceptance (`AITL-BOLT-DONE-Approval`). This template is kept **dormant** for
> a redesigned model planned in a future version. The frontmatter and
> body below describe the future (reserved) UAT process, not an active gate.

<!--
  LANGUAGE POLICY (§3.15): YAML keys, status enums, IDs, and section
  headings (##) stay in English (the schema). All prose — observations,
  feedback, sign-off notes — goes in the project's content_language
  (declared in devflow/LANGUAGE).

  ⚠️ AITL-UAT-Approval (§3.0): stakeholders sign off the Unit/Milestone.
  The UAT minutes in tests/uat/ are the evidence — the Bolt manifest
  carries NO UAT data (§3.12).

  ⚠️ Review contract (§3.0): review.decision uses the universal enum
  approved | changes_requested | rejected. The document status
  approved-with-observations is a UAT lifecycle label, not a decision
  value: it means review.decision: approved with non-empty findings[] —
  every finding routes to a new Bolt (section 4 below).

# UAT-NNN — [Unit / Milestone]

## 1. Scope validated

[Summary of what this UAT session covers — which Bolts, which user-visible
behaviour, which process flows.]

## 2. Signing stakeholders

| Name | Role | Signature | Date |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| @user |     |           |      |

## 3. Results per criterion (business ACs)

| AC    | Description | Result        | Evidence | Observation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| AC-01 |             | [ok] / [warn] / [fail] |          |             |
| AC-02 |             | [ok] / [warn] / [fail] |          |             |

> Each AC must trace to a vision outcome or process rule. List the link in
> the *Observation* column when not obvious.

## 4. Agreed adjustments (derived Bolts)

- [ ] US-NNN.BOLT-NNN — [adjustment]
- [ ] US-NNN.BOLT-NNN — [adjustment]

## 5. Final decision

- [ ] Approved
- [ ] Approved with observations (Bolts listed above)
- [ ] Rejected — reason: [...]

## 6. AITL-UAT-Approval

> **Avenga DevFlow §3.0.** Stakeholders sign off the Unit/Milestone here and
> in the `review` frontmatter block. The UAT minutes are the evidence —
> the Bolt manifest deliberately carries no UAT data (§3.12).
