<!--
  LANGUAGE POLICY (§3.15): YAML keys, status enums, IDs, and section
  headings (##) stay in English (the schema). All prose — findings,
  observations, recommendations — goes in the project's content_language
  (declared in devflow/LANGUAGE).

  ⚠️ AITL-REV-Approval (§2.14, §3.0): findings remain DRAFT until a
  qualified human records AITL-REV-Approval. Approval does NOT approve any
  downstream artifact. Code-related outcomes still require an approved Bolt
  (T10 — never REV → SPEC directly). The V-Bounce checkpoint is
  AITL-MEM-Approval, recorded in the Bolt manifest — never conflate the two.

# REV-NNN — [Descriptive title]

| Field           | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Scope**       | [modules / projects reviewed] |
| **Methodology** | [static inspection, ADR compliance, etc.] |
| **Criteria**    | [ADRs and standards against which we review] |

---

## 1. Purpose

[Why this review exists. What we aim to verify.]

---

## 2. Artifacts reviewed

| Artifact | Files | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
|          |       |       |

---

## 3. Severity legend

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Compliant** | Implemented correctly per ADR / standard |
| **Documented deviation** | Justified difference, recorded in MEM |
| **Minor gap** | Inconsistency without functional impact, reduces quality |
| **Major gap** | Problem that can cause runtime errors or security exposure |

---

## 4. Findings

### 4.1 — [Domain / Category]

#### F-01 [Major gap] — [Finding title]

**Location:** `path/file.ext` line N

**Actual:** [What the code does today]

**Expected:** [What it should do per ADR / standard]

**Impact:** [Consequences of not fixing]

**Recommendation:** [Proposed fix]

---

#### F-02 [Minor gap] — [Finding title]

**Location:** `path/file.ext` line N

**Actual:** [...]

**Expected:** [...]

**Impact:** [...]

**Recommendation:** [...]

---

### 4.2 — [Another domain / Category]

#### F-03 [Compliant] — [What is correct]

[Brief description of what meets the standard.]

---

## 5. Summary

[Overall state in 2-3 sentences.]

---

## 6. Action plan

> Applies only after `AITL-REV-Approval`. Each destination follows its own
> lifecycle and AITL approval (code → approved Bolt first, T10).

| # | Finding | Severity | Action | Routes to |
|---|---------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | F-01    | Major    |        | BUG / BOLT→SPEC / ADR / RISK / DISC |
| 2 | F-02    | Minor    |        | BOLT→SPEC |

---

## 7. Conclusions

[Overall state and recommendation: can we proceed? Is another review
cycle needed?]

---

## 8. AITL-REV-Approval

> **Avenga DevFlow §2.14, §3.0.** This Review remains a draft until a
> qualified human records `AITL-REV-Approval` (in the `review` frontmatter
> block). Approval makes the findings actionable; it does not approve any
> downstream artifact. The V-Bounce checkpoint is `AITL-MEM-Approval`
> (recorded in the Bolt manifest's `checkpoint_approvals[]`) — a REV and a
> V-Bounce approval are different events.

| Field | Value |

| **Reviewer** | [qualified human designated for the Review] |
| **Decision** | approved / changes_requested / rejected |
| **review_ready_at** | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:MM` |
| **review.started_at** | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:MM` |
| **review.decided_at** | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:MM` |
