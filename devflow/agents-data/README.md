# Agents Data (Per-Agent Shared Knowledge)

**Methodology version:** 5.1

## Purpose

Per-agent shared knowledge areas under source control, visible to the whole
team. This folder exists so agents never improvise new folders inside
`devflow/` (G30): the canonical structure is fixed, and `agents-data/` is the
sanctioned free-form area.

There are **no pre-created subfolders**: each agent creates its own folder
on first use — `agents-data/<agent-name>/` — and is **responsible for
everything inside it**. Inside its own folder the agent is free to create
files and subfolders; that freedom is the point of the folder.

Everything here is **versioned with the repository and shared with the team**:
it holds durable, useful information — patterns, reusable knowledge,
environment notes, design decisions — that any team member or other agent can
read.

## How it works

- **First use:** create your folder `agents-data/<agent-name>/` the first
  time you need it. Creating it is sanctioned by G30 — any other new folder
  inside `devflow/` is not.
- **Ownership:** each agent is responsible for its own folder — content,
  organization, and keeping it durable and team-useful. Do not create files
  in another agent's folder; if you need to share something, the user decides
  where it goes.
- **Scans:** agents use their own folder freely; they do not search other
  agents' folders proactively (token economy) — only when the user explicitly
  asks or references content there.

## What goes here

- Durable knowledge an agent wants to share with the team and persist in
  version control: patterns, conventions, learned behaviors, environment
  notes, reusable reference material.
- Anything that is useful beyond the session that produced it.

## What does NOT go here

- **Never temporary data.** Drafts, tool outputs, large intermediates, or any
  disposable content belong in the OS temp directory (W21) — never in a
  versioned, team-shared folder.
- **Never governed evidence:** nothing in `agents-data/` is governed input.
  It may never be cited as the source or justification of a SPEC, Bolt, ADR,
  US, TC, BUG, MEM, or any AITL checkpoint (G32). Treat it like
  `analysis/introduction/` (§5.5): narrative support, never evidence.
- **Not a replacement for `memory/`:** one MEM per V-Bounce remains mandatory
  (§2.12). Implementation memory is governed and immutable; `agents-data/`
  is informal shared knowledge.
- **Not personal memory:** preferences and session memory belong to each
  platform's **native memory mechanism** — the platform owns its location,
  which may change without notice; the methodology never dictates memory
  paths. `agents-data/` is committed, shared, and visible to the whole team.
- **Not a replacement for `_archive/`:** lifecycle-closed documents belong in
  each folder's `_archive/` subfolder (§5.4), not here.

## Rules

- **One area per agent:** each agent writes only inside its own
  `agents-data/<agent-name>/` folder, created by that agent on first use.
- **No other new folders:** creating a folder under `agents-data/` without
  being your own named area — or anywhere else inside `devflow/` — is a G30
  violation.
- **No AITL checkpoints:** nothing in this folder is approved, reviewed, or
  traceable; it has no `review:` contract and no lifecycle.
- **Shared and versioned:** content is committed like any other
  documentation; keep it durable, readable, and team-useful. Do not commit
  secrets, credentials, or environment-sensitive data.

## Language

IDs and any schema-like content stay in English. File name slugs and prose
follow the project's `content_language`, declared in
[`../LANGUAGE`](../LANGUAGE) (§3.15).
